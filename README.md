Canada Facts

The Task to write a simple iOS application to meet the following specifications and emphasize my knowledge and fluency in mobile app development.

Specification

• Create a universal iOS app using Swift which:
• Ingests a json feed https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/s/2iodh4vg0eortkl/facts.json
• You can use a third party Json parser to parse this if desired.
• Displays the content (including image, title and description)
• The title in the navbar should be updated from the json
• Each row should be the right height to display its own content and no taller. No content should be clipped. This means some rows will be larger than others.
• Don’t download all images at once, only as needed
• Refresh function, either a refresh button or use pull down to refresh.
• Should not block UI when loading the data from the json feed.
• Support all iOS versions from the latest back at least 2 versions

Guidelines

• Use Git to manage the source code. A clear Git history showing your process is required.
• Structure your code according to industry best practice design patterns
• Do not use any .xib files or Story Boards
• Scrolling the table view should be smooth, even as images are downloading and getting
added to the cells
• Support both iPhone and iPad (in both orientations) all devices including iPhoneX
• If threading is used, do no spawn threads manually use GCD queues instead.
• Comment your code when necessary.
• Try to polish your code and the apps functionality as much as possible.
• Commit your changes to git in small chunks with meaningful comments
• Feel free to use open source components via Cocoapods or Carthage if it makes sense

Additonal Requirement

• Style your code according to this style guide https://github.com/linkedin/swift-style-guide
• Use programmatic auto layout using Layout Constraints to layout the cells in the app
• Use the Alamofire framework for your service calls
• Please use a CollectionView as the container and if possible multiple columns on iPad
